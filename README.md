# Snake Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features a snake that the player controls using the arrow keys, with the objective of eating food to grow longer while avoiding collisions with the walls and itself.

## Features:
- **Canvas Rendering**: The game is rendered on an HTML5 canvas for smooth graphics.
- **Responsive Controls**: Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake.
- **Collision Detection**: The game detects collisions with the walls and the snake itself, ending the game if a collision occurs.
- **Score Tracking**: The score increases as the snake eats food, providing a simple way to track progress.

## How to Play:
1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Use the arrow keys to navigate the snake.
3. Eat the red food squares to grow the snake and increase your score.
4. Avoid running into the walls or the snake's own body.

## Installation:
No installation is required. Simply clone the repository and open `index.html` in your web browser to start playing.
